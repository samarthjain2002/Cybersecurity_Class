Triad(CIA/Pillars of Security)
C - Confidentiality
I - Integrity
A - Availability

A - Authenticity
NR - Non-reputational

Confidentiality: In confidentiality, data exchange between two people is not accessible to the third person.
Integrity - In integrity, data exchange between two people should not be tampered.
Availability - At any given point of time, data should be accessible to its legitimate user.
Authenticity - Before providing the data, the system has to verify - Is the user same as he portrays?
Non-reputational - A person shouldn't be able to deny the activity he performed.
				   A person cannot deny his activity after performing it.

Data states
1) Data in Transit
2) Data in Use
3) Data at Rest

1) Data in Transit - When the data is moving
2) Data in Use - When the data is being processed
3) Data at Rest - When the data is not moving

OSIG (Open-Source Information Gathering)

Hacking Phases
1) Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
   Capturing information about the target
2) Extrapolation (Gaining access)
3) Privilege Escalation
4) Maintaining access
   Creating a backdoor
5) Erase Traces
   Clearing logs (Clearing footprints)
